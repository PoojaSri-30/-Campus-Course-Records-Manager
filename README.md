# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

## Project Overview
**Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)** is a console-based Java application for managing students, courses, grades, and academic records in an institute. It demonstrates advanced Java concepts including OOP principles, file handling, streams, lambdas, design patterns, and more.

## Project Requirements

This is a **Java SE** project built and run locally. The project must follow the specifications below:

- **Project Structure:** Use clear and organized packages.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - **Encapsulation:** Properly encapsulate class fields and provide access via getters/setters.
  - **Inheritance:** Use class hierarchy to reuse common functionality.
  - **Abstraction:** Use abstract classes for shared behavior.
  - **Polymorphism:** Implement method overriding and interface implementation.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust handling of runtime and input errors.
- **Modern Java Features:**
  - **File I/O with NIO.2:** Efficient file handling for reading/writing data.
  - **Streams & Lambdas:** Use for processing collections and data efficiently.
  - **Date/Time API:** Manage dates (e.g., enrollment date, session periods) using `java.time`.
- **Advanced Java Concepts:**
  - **Interfaces & Abstract Classes:** Define contracts and shared behaviors.
  - **Nested Classes & Enums:** Organize related functionality and constants.
  - **Recursion:** Implement recursive methods where appropriate.
- **Design Patterns:**
  - **Singleton:** Ensure a single instance of the main system manager.
  - **Builder:** Construct complex objects like Students and Courses efficiently.
